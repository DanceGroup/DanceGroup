## Project Introduction

<br/>
This project tries to address the challenges in traditional network brought by data-driven serverless computing. First, we will redesign the serverless computing network architecture in the traditional network. Second, we will give a deep analysis on the above network design a new service mode from the aspect of traffic engineering, scheduling, etc. Third, we will design data-driven algorithm for the serverless computing architecture with high instability and low predictability, so as to improve the quality of service.

## **Research Content**

<br/>

1. Redesign of network architecture based on serverless computing

2. Redefinition of classical problems and design of new service modes on the basis of serverless network

3. Performance optimization of data-driven algorithms in serverless computing
