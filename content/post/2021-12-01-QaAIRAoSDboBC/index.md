## Abstract

<br/>

Driving biodiversity into investment at scale. Financial institutions globally will require biodiversity data to support their analysis of environmental risk and opportunity in order to meet fiduciary requirements. But whilst international regulators and financial institutions are demanding investor reporting on nature impact, there is a lack of credible data. This project fills this gap by providing science-based, AI and machine learning powered biodiversity analytics to global financial institutions, and we also provide insights on nature footprint, risks and impacts.
